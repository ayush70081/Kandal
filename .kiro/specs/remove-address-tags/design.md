# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the complete removal of address and tag functionality from the report submission system. The changes will simplify the user interface and reduce backend complexity by eliminating two optional components that are not essential to the core reporting functionality.

Based on the current implementation analysis, the following components need modification:
- Frontend: `ReportSubmission.jsx` component contains address form fields and tags input
- Backend: Report model includes address schema and tags array, controller processes these fields
- Backend: Routes include validation for address and tags fields

## Architecture

The removal will follow a clean architecture approach:

### Frontend Layer
- Remove address section UI components from `ReportSubmission.jsx`
- Remove tags input field from `ReportSubmission.jsx`
- Update form state management to exclude address and tags
- Remove related CSS styles from `ReportSubmission.css`
- Update form validation to not require these fields

### Backend Layer
- Remove address and tags fields from report model schema
- Update controller logic to not process address/tags data
- Remove validation rules for address and tags in routes
- Ensure existing reports with address/tags data remain functional

### Data Layer
- Keep existing database records intact (no data migration needed)
- New reports will simply not include address/tags fields
- Database queries remain unchanged as they don't depend on these fields

## Components and Interfaces

### Frontend Components

#### ReportSubmission.jsx Changes
1. **State Management Updates**
   - Remove `address` object from `formData` state
   - Remove `tags` string from `formData` state
   - Update `handleChange` function to not handle address nested properties

2. **UI Component Removal**
   - Remove entire "Address (Optional)" subsection from location section
   - Remove "Additional Information" section containing tags input
   - Update form layout to maintain proper spacing and flow

3. **Form Validation Updates**
   - Remove address-related validation logic
   - Remove tags-related validation logic
   - Update `validateForm` function accordingly

4. **Form Submission Updates**
   - Remove address data from FormData preparation
   - Remove tags data from FormData preparation
   - Simplify form submission payload

#### ReportSubmission.css Changes
1. Remove styles for:
   - `.address-section`
   - `.subsection-title` (if only used for address)
   - Any address-specific form styling
   - Tags-related styling

### Backend Components

#### Report Model (report.model.js) Changes
1. **Schema Updates**
   - Remove `address` field definition and nested schema
   - Remove `tags` array field definition
   - Keep all other fields intact

2. **Validation Updates**
   - Remove address validation logic
   - Remove tags validation logic
   - Maintain all other validation rules

#### Report Controller (report.controller.js) Changes
1. **submitReport Function Updates**
   - Remove address parsing from request body
   - Remove tags processing from request body
   - Remove address assignment to reportData
   - Remove tags assignment to reportData
   - Keep all other functionality intact

2. **Other Functions**
   - No changes needed as they don't specifically process address/tags

#### Report Routes (report.routes.js) Changes
1. **Validation Rules Updates**
   - Remove address validation from `submitReportValidation`
   - Remove tags validation from `submitReportValidation`
   - Keep all other validation rules intact

## Data Models

### Updated Report Schema
The report model will have the following structure after removal:

```javascript
{
  // Basic incident information (unchanged)
  title: String,
  incidentType: String,
  description: String,
  severity: String,
  
  // Location information (coordinates only)
  location: {
    type: String,
    coordinates: [Number]
  },
  // address: REMOVED
  
  // Photo evidence (unchanged)
  photos: [PhotoSchema],
  
  // Reporter information (unchanged)
  reporter: ObjectId,
  
  // Status and validation (unchanged)
  status: String,
  priority: String,
  validatedBy: ObjectId,
  validatedAt: Date,
  validationNotes: String,
  
  // AI validation (unchanged)
  aiValidation: Object,
  
  // Follow-up actions (unchanged)
  actions: [ActionSchema],
  
  // Additional metadata (tags removed)
  // tags: REMOVED
  isPublic: Boolean,
  viewCount: Number,
  upvotes: [UpvoteSchema],
  comments: [CommentSchema]
}
```

### Form Data Structure
The frontend form state will be simplified to:

```javascript
{
  title: '',
  incidentType: 'illegal_cutting',
  description: '',
  severity: 'medium',
  location: {
    latitude: null,
    longitude: null
  }
  // address: REMOVED
  // tags: REMOVED
}
```

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling
- Remove address-related error handling
- Remove tags-related error handling
- Maintain existing error handling for all other fields
- Ensure form validation errors are properly displayed

### Backend Error Handling
- Remove address validation error responses
- Remove tags validation error responses
- Maintain all other error handling mechanisms
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing error handling

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing
1. **Form Rendering Tests**
   - Verify address section is not rendered
   - Verify tags input is not rendered
   - Verify all other form elements render correctly

2. **Form Submission Tests**
   - Test successful submission without address/tags
   - Verify form data doesn't include address/tags fields
   - Test form validation works correctly

3. **User Interaction Tests**
   - Test form completion flow
   - Verify no broken UI elements after removal
   - Test responsive design still works

### Backend Testing
1. **API Endpoint Tests**
   - Test report submission without address/tags
   - Verify successful report creation
   - Test validation rules work correctly

2. **Data Model Tests**
   - Test report creation with new schema
   - Verify existing reports still function
   - Test database operations work correctly

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test full submission flow from frontend to backend
   - Verify data consistency
   - Test error handling scenarios

### Regression Testing
1. **Existing Functionality**
   - Verify all other report features work unchanged
   - Test report listing and viewing
   - Test report validation and status updates

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Verify existing reports with address/tags remain accessible
   - Test that removal doesn't break existing queries
   - Ensure no data corruption occurs
