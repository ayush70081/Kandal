# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the address section and tag section completely from the report submission functionality. The goal is to simplify the report submission process by eliminating these two components from both the frontend user interface and the backend data handling. This will streamline the user experience and reduce the complexity of the report submission form.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user submitting a report, I want a simplified form without address and tag fields, so that I can focus on the essential report information without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the report submission page THEN the system SHALL NOT display any address input fields
2. WHEN a user navigates to the report submission page THEN the system SHALL NOT display any tag input fields
3. WHEN a user submits a report THEN the system SHALL process the submission without requiring address or tag data
4. WHEN a user views the report submission form THEN the system SHALL show only the remaining essential fields

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to stop processing address and tag data, so that the system maintains data consistency and doesn't store unused information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a report submission request THEN the system SHALL NOT expect address fields in the request payload
2. WHEN the backend receives a report submission request THEN the system SHALL NOT expect tag fields in the request payload
3. WHEN the backend processes a report THEN the system SHALL NOT validate address or tag data
4. WHEN the backend saves a report THEN the system SHALL NOT store address or tag information in the database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want all address and tag related code removed, so that the codebase is clean and doesn't contain unused functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the frontend components THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any address-related form fields or validation
2. WHEN reviewing the frontend components THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any tag-related form fields or validation
3. WHEN reviewing the backend routes THEN the system SHALL NOT contain address or tag validation middleware
4. WHEN reviewing the backend models THEN the system SHALL NOT contain address or tag schema definitions for reports
5. WHEN reviewing the backend controllers THEN the system SHALL NOT contain address or tag processing logic
