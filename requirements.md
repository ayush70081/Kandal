# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive admin dashboard for the Mangrove application that allows administrators to manage user reports, assign badges, visualize approved reports on a map, and perform analytics. The admin dashboard will serve as the central hub for content moderation and system oversight, enabling administrators to review submitted reports, approve or reject them, reward users with badges, and gain insights through data visualization and analytics.

5. WHEN an admin approves or rejects a report THEN the system SHALL send appropriate notifications to the report submitter

### Requirement 4
